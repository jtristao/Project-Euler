# Project-Euler
A colection of Project Euler's solutions.

# Reference:
	e_xxx.c -> c program.
	e_xxx.txt -> text devolpment of the solution
	e_xxx.in -> input used in the matching c program
	s_xxx.c -> a reviewed and optimized answer.

# Notes:
	-The input file can be used through command line:
		$gcc e_xxx.c -o executable_name
		$./executable_name < e_xxx.in
	-In some especial cases, there are instructions on how to use the program in the header 
	
The problems can be found on https://projecteuler.net/.
